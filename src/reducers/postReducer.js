What's a Reducer?
    It is a function that takes the current state and 
    an action that was dispatched as itâ€™s parameters and returns the new state.

// Step 3: Setup Reducer for the store

// Setting up postReducer so that
// we can combine this reducer with other reducers later 
// and make a big object for the store 
// reducer should mandatorily return a state. 
const postReducer = (state = [], action ) => { // action will have action.type and action.payload

   // Step 8.1 
  //now it is time to understand the concept called 'Actions'
  //What are Actions? 
  //Actions are plain Javascript objects with a type property. 
  //This type property describes the event that is taking place 
  //in the application. 
  // action.type = Event
