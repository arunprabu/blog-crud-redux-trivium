Step 0: 
  npm i react-router-dom

Step 1: 
  Plan on the URLs.

  localhost:3000/
  localhost:3000/posts
  localhost:3000/about

  Have the URL's in Header.js 

Step 2: 
  Check the page. URL should change. History will be maintained. 

  Let's identify the matching components against the URL's 

  localhost:3000/         - Home  (Fn Comp)
  localhost:3000/posts    - Posts (Fn Comp)
  localhost:3000/about    - About (Fn Comp)

Step 3: 
  Let's configure the routes in App.js 
  to do this, put the entire app under BrowserRouter from react-router-dom 

  import { BrowserRouter, Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';

  Now, Let's focus on configuring the routes in between Header and Footer

  <Switch>
    <Route path='/' component={Home} exact/>
    <Route path='/posts' component={Posts}/>
    <Route path='/about' component={About} />
  </Switch>

Step 4:
  Page is still refreshing. Let's stop it.
  in Header.js 

  import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';

  replace <a href> with <Link to>
